# Customer Experience (CX) Feedback Analysis Dashboard: Transforming Insights into Action

## Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic Customer Experience (CX) Analysis Dashboard designed to provide a holistic view of customer feedback, with a particular focus on identifying and understanding sources of "bad feedback." By visualizing key metrics across various dimensions – including order status, payment methods, geographical distribution, and product performance – this dashboard empowers businesses to quickly pinpoint pain points, enhance operational efficiency, and significantly improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this dashboard is to:
* Quantify and categorize customer feedback into good, bad and average sentiments.
* Identify trends and anomalies in negative feedback over time and by shipping method.
* Determine which countries are generating the most negative feedback.
* Uncover products associated with the highest "bad CX value," indicating areas for product improvement.
* Provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making in customer service, logistics, and product development.
