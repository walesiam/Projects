**Customer Segmentation Analysis**
This project performs a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

**Key Highlights**:
Data Preprocessing: The analysis begins with a robust data cleaning process, handling missing values and converting data types to ensure data quality and consistency.
RFM Feature Engineering: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values are calculated for each customer, providing a quantitative basis for segmentation.

**Recency**: Time since the last purchase, calculated in days from the latest transaction date in the dataset.

**Frequency**: Total number of purchases made by each customer.

**Monetary**: Total amount spent by each customer, rounded to two decimal places.

**RFM Scoring and Segmentation**: Customers are assigned RFM scores based on predefined criteria, and then categorized into "Low-Value," "Mid-Value," and "High-Value" segments. This allows for a clear understanding of customer worth and potential.

**Actionable Insights**: The resulting customer segments provide valuable insights for businesses to:
Tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer behaviors.
Identify and reward high-value customers.
Develop strategies to re-engage dormant or low-value customers.
Optimize product offerings and promotional activities.
